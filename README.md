# Spoiler for Lotus car

During my work at MCAE systems, s.r.o., I am in preparation of exhibits for msv - international engineering fair. He was given the task of designing an existing spoiler design that did not include a stop light. Modern 3D technologies, such as 3D scanning, reverse engineering and 3D printing, were widely used in the design.

In the summer of 2018, a few months before the fair, I saw a yellow Lotus sports car in the company car park in the morning on my way to work. Such a meeting is not uncommon in this company. Already in the past, various owners of veterans in vain efforts in search of adequate spare parts turned to us with a request for production. The usual procedure is for the customer to deliver a component that is damaged or unusable in some way. In the first phase of reconstruction and reconditioning, the part is scanned, ie its physical form is converted into electronic form. The computer model logically entails also errors and shape defects of the original. It is therefore necessary to repair the model and add missing parts to create a faithful replica. However, somewhere there is a requirement to modify the model, where the shape is complemented by new elements.

The same case was the spoiler for the yellow sports car Lotos, specifically the Elise Sport 220 - wiki. The car is not produced as standard with a spoiler, but this Lotus has already been equipped with a spoiler. My job was to break the center molding and create a contiguous and aerodynamic clean shape that would copy the original shape in the side sections.
